## **Usage**  
The bot responds to slash commands with images tailored to the command's color. Here's how you can use it:  

### **Slash Commands**  
| Command        | Description                                         | Example Result                  |  
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|  
| `/blue`        | Generates an image matching the blue command.       | ![Image](https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp9020669.jpg) |  
| `/minimalist`  | Generates a minimalist image that matches the theme.| ![Image](https://c4.wallpaperflare.com/wallpaper/877/791/778/minimalism-sunset-simple-background-wallpaper-thumb.jpg)|  
| `/random`      | Show help for using the bot.                        | Try typing ```/space```         |

## **Command Color Logic**  
The bot analyzes the **color** of each slash command and chooses a random image and posts the image to the channel that the slash command was used in.  

### **Example Commands**  
- **Red Commands**: Warm, fiery aesthetics (sunsets, flames).  
- **Blue Commands**: Cool, tranquil aesthetics (oceans, skies).  
- **Gotcic Commands**: Dark and whimsy aesthetics  (forests, meadows).  
- **Space Commands**: Space aesthetics with space related images (nebulae, galaxies).
